# Linked List Operations with JavaScript

## Introduction

A linked list is a linear data structure consisting of a sequence of elements where each element points to the next one, forming a chain-like structure. Here's a guide to common operations on linked lists using JavaScript.

## Initializing a Linked List

```javascript
class Node {
    constructor(data) {
        this.data = data;
        this.next = null;
    }
}

class LinkedList {
    constructor() {
        this.head = null;
    }

    // Operations will be listed below
}
```
